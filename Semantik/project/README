Requirements:

    - spaCy
        pip install -U spacy
        
    - the spaCy English model
        python -m spacy download en

Usage: 

    python word_overlap_clustering.py -h
    
    Example:
    python word_overlap_clustering.py -i path/to/dataset/ -o output_file.txt -t 0.04
    
    NB: word_overlap_clustering.py imports bag_of_wording.py. This should work out-of-the-box, but in case it doesn't, an empty __init__.py file in the directory should fix that.
    
    
Files:

    word_overlap_clustering.py          The clustering algorithm + output writer
    
    bag_of_wording.py                   The preprocessing (includes both spaCy and TreeTagger options).
    
    dimitrova_project_report.pdf        The project report
    
    output_test.txt                     The clustering produced on the test data.
                                        Can be replicated with:
                                        python word_overlap_clustering.py -i path/to/test/dataset -o output_test.txt
                                        
    tagged.txt                          The TreeTagger file of the TRIAL dataset, used in the 
                                        Simplified system's preprocessing. 
                                        (Only here in case recomputing is necessary.)
                                        Baseline replication:
                                        python word_overlap_clustering.py -i path/to/trial/dataset -o
                                        baseline_trial.txt -b
